      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I have a background in analytical thinking, attention to detail, and quick adaptation to new
        systems, which I am currently applying in my transition to the IT field. Experience in PPC
        marketing, high-level administration, and customer service has provided me with a solid
        foundation for working with data, problem-solving, and effective team communication. I
        actively develop my programming and language skills with the goal of smoothly moving into a
        technical role. I attend React Girls meetups and want to participate in a mentorship
        program. I currently work on a Mac, but have previously worked with Linux as well.
