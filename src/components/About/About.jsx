          I have a background in analytical thinking, attention to detail, and quick adaptation to
          new systems, which I am currently applying in my transition to the IT field. Experience in
          PPC marketing, high-level administration, and customer service has provided me with a
          solid foundation for working with data, problem-solving, and effective team communication.
          I actively develop my programming and language skills with the goal of smoothly moving
          into a technical role. I attend React Girls meetups and want to participate in a
          mentorship program. I currently work on a Mac, but have previously worked with Linux as
          well.
